## Experience
### [SkillMapper](https://skillmapper.com/), Software Engineer Intern
 
Since the beginning of September, I've been a part-time Software Engineer Intern at SkillMapper, working on the front end of their website. 
 
### FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 4201

In 11th and 12th grade, I was a member of my school's FRC team. I worked on programming robots in Java. In 12th grade, I was a Software Director, responsible for leading the team's programming tasks. In FRC, I loved experiencing the excitement of solving problems and seeing my code work in a competition setting.

## Projects
### [Gaming Website](https://github.com/benjaminJohnson2204/GamingWebsite)

This is a website I created for playing single-player and multi-player games. So far, users can play Tic-Tac-Toe, Dots and Boxes, and Tetris. I also have an authentication and friends system, where users can send each other friend requests and play against their friends. 

I used Express and Node for the server, React for the front end, a MongoDB database for users, friends, and games, Konva for rendering games, and Socket.IO for real-time client-server communication. I also used Passport and Bcrypt for session authentication.

### [E-commerce Website](https://github.com/benjaminJohnson2204/rugs-website)

I developed this website to be a platform for users to view and buy rugs, and for admins to post new rugs. Users can add rugs to their carts and then check out, just like a real e-commerce site but without actual payments. Users can also subscribe to receive emails when an admin posts a new rug. 

I made a Django server, using Django REST Framework to create REST APIs to authenticate users and track rugs, orders, and carts. I used Django's ORM and default SQLite database. I wrote the front end using React and TypeScript.

### [Algorithm Visualizations](https://github.com/benjaminJohnson2204/Algorithm-Visualizations)

I built this website as a way for students to visualize, and therefore better understand, various CS-related algorithms. So far, I have visualizations for arrays and linked lists. 

I used Next.js, React, and TypeScript, as well as D3 to display and animate shapes that represent the data structures (for example, bars of different heights for array elements).

### [Studying App](https://github.com/benjaminJohnson2204/studying-app)

I created a mobile app using Flutter for users to review and study by answering practice problems. The app tracks their progress, so they can see how many questions they're getting right and wrong.

I wrote an Express server, with a MongoDB database, to handle token authentication and supply problems, answers, and users' progress to the front end.
